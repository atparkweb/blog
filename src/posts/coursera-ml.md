I've been interested in machine learning for quite sometime. I've read a few
blog posts about <abbr>ML</abbr>, but I embarassed to say that I haven't been serious about
studying it or applying it in my work. I decided to finally take the plunge and
enroll in [Coursera's free machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?).

The first week covered the fundamentals of <abbr>ML</abbr> including
linear regression and gradient descent.

Linear regression is method of modeling a linear function to predict an output
given one or more inputs.
The concept of univariate (single input variable) linear regression was easy
enough for me to understand.

Gradient descent is an algorithm used for optimizing a linear
regression. Basically it's a way of finding the linear function that can best
predict an output given any input. The algorithm gradually converges on the
function with the most accurate prediction results on an input parameter.
The theory behind gradient descent involves derivatives, so I had to search 
the corners of my brain where my old knowledge of calculus was hidden.

This week will introduce multivariate (more than one input parameter) linear
regressions. This seems a bit more challenging than simple univariate linear
regressions, but I'm looking forward to learning more, and getting into writing code.

Learning something new is always a struggle at first, but as long time and
effort are invested, it is a rewarding exercise.
