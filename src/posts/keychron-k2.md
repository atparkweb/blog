I have been working without a keyboard for about one
year until about two weeks ago. I missed using a mechanical keyboard, so I bought a [Keychron K2 keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard).
I decided on the Keychron K2, because of it's small size and reasonable price.

I wanted a small keyboard that I could easily transport for travel or work outside of my home.
I also wanted something under $100 because I didn't want to invest a lot of money into a keyboard.
I already have a Mistel Barroco keyboard in the US, that wasn't cheap, and I
couldn't justify dropping a bunch of money on a new keyboard.

I chose the non-RGB version because I already have RGB LEDs in my Mistel, and
I'm not that into RGB keyboards to be honest. The white backlit keys are nice, and a lot of
different effects are included.
I didn't like the way that the orange ESC key looked when lit up (translucent, bright, and cheap looking), so I just swapped it out for one of the included solid gray replacement key caps.

I chose the brown switch option (over blue or red), and I like them better than the red switches in my Mistel. The brown switches are little bit quieter and less bouncy than the red ones, which suits my typing style. The only thing I miss about my Mistel is the ergonomic split keyboard feature.

Overall I'm happy with the Keychron K2.
I recommend it for anyone looking for a nice small mechanical keyboard at a reasonable price.
