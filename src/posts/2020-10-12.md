I've just received a Keychron K2 keyboard. I have been without a keyboard for
the past year. I have two keyboards in storage in the United States, which I
planned to bring to Japan, but due to the global pandemic, I've had to postpone
my return visit to the states. I tried my best to just wait and make due with my laptop keyboard, but I finally gave up and purchased the K2.

I decided on the Keychron K2, because of it's small size and reasonable price.
I wanted something small that I could easily transport, in cases where I travel
or work outside of my home office. I also didn't want to invest a lot of money into a keyboard.
I already have a Mistel Barroco keyboard in the US, and that wasn't cheap.

After using it for about two weeks, I love it!
I went with the brown switches, and they feel much better than the red
switches in my Mistel Barocco. A little bit quieter and less bounce which suit
my typing style.
The only thing I miss about my Mistel is the ergonomic split keyboard
feature.

I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend this keyboard.
